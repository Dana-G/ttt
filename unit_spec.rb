# make an empty board with 3 x 3 hardcoded
# makes user pick if X or O
# always starts with player 1
# input validation: is the user giving us legal input value of letter symbol on the board
# input validation: is space empty via nil or null
# input validation: no numbers, length only 1 (sarahs grad school solution)
# (just check for what you do want, not what you don't want)
# track whats empty and use for legal input checker
# input & show input on board
# check if placement is winning combination
# if not winning move, player 2 goes, if yes start new game or quit
